        <hr style="height:50%"> Joseph Francis "Joey" Tribbiani Jr., was one of the main characters on Friends (1994–2004) and the title character in the spin-off Joey (2004–2006). He was portrayed by Matt LeBlanc.

        <h3>
            Joey comes from an Italian-American family of eight children, of which he is the only male. He is from, and presumably born in, Queens. As a child, he was extremely accident prone. In "The One With Ross' New Girlfriend", it's implied that he was sexually
            abused as a child by a tailor, but did not realize this until Chandler went to the same place years later. As a child, he had an imaginary friend named Maurice, who was a space cowboy. He meets most of the friends (with the exception of Rachel)
            as a result of being Chandler's roommate. Joey meets Rachel a while later, at Central Perk when she runs out on her planned wedding with Barry.
